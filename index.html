  <h1>My Testimony</h1>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>It’s kind of funny how life works out sometimes. I remember when I was very young, around the time I was in middle school, and me and my brother would end up staying at home alone in the Summer while my parents were at work. It was a pretty chill time. Back then most of my life consisted of watching SpongeBob and eating chicken nuggets. That George Foreman grill never did fail us. We were only interrupted at times when random people would ring our doorbell. They were probably just folks trying to sell something to us. We wouldn’t answer obviously. “We don’t want what you’re selling!” Ok, we didn’t actually yell that, but maybe if we did they would have gone away faster. But of course it didn’t end there. They would think that for some reason the doorbell was broken or malfunctioning, and then they would begin to knock on the door over and over. My gosh do these people ever give up?</p>

    <p>I remember the funniest moments would be when the Jehovah’s Witnesses came over. My brother and I recognized them now since we had seen them a few times already. We could recognize them from their car pulling into the cul-de-sac we lived in. We knew the protocol. Turn off the lights. Turn the TV volume down so SpongeBob wouldn’t give away our presence. Then we would wait while we silently ate our chicken nuggets. First came the ring, then the knock on the door. Finally after a few minutes we would hear the car drive away. All right, finally that’s over. Now we could go back to watching SpongeBob in peace. Some nerve, coming over here and thinking their religion was superior to everyone else’s. Didn’t they have anything better to do then go around preaching what they thought was the truth? Didn’t everyone think they had the truth? I mean which person follows a religion they think is fake? Just keep your beliefs to yourself please, I can choose for myself what path I want to follow.</p>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The thing was, perhaps I didn’t truly have a path to follow either. But no one really knows if what they believe is actually true, they just choose to believe in what they want. Or so I thought. I held a perspective of God that didn’t quite match any religion. I mean I believed in a God, but not a specific one. Just a God. A God that I thought was good, loving, and apparently a creative genius to have constructed a world such as this one. This is what I assumed after studying science as a young kid before and all throughout high school. Chemistry, Biology, Physics. It was all so crazy to me. How did this stuff all just come together? Random chance? Maybe. I guess you could say that despite the low probability of life forming by itself, you must also take into account that there are quite a bit of possibilities considering the vast size of the universe. Did you know that your body (assuming you’re an adult) contains 7 octillion atoms (you google how many zeros that is) while the Milky Way Galaxy has only around 300-400 billion stars? Do you know that the atoms in your own body are billions of years old? Yeah, you probably do.</p>
