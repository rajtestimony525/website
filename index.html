  <h1>My Testimony</h1>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I wrote this back when I was 20 years old or so. It was like 2 years or so after meeting Mr. J</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>It’s kind of funny how life works out sometimes. I remember when I was very young, around the time I was in middle school, and me and my brother would end up staying at home alone in the Summer while my parents were at work. It was a pretty chill time. Back then most of my life consisted of watching SpongeBob and eating chicken nuggets. That George Foreman grill never did fail us. We were only interrupted at times when random people would ring our doorbell. They were probably just folks trying to sell something to us. We wouldn’t answer obviously. “We don’t want what you’re selling!” Ok, we didn’t actually yell that, but maybe if we did they would have gone away faster. But of course it didn’t end there. They would think that for some reason the doorbell was broken or malfunctioning, and then they would begin to knock on the door over and over. My gosh do these people ever give up?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I remember the funniest moments would be when the Jehovah’s Witnesses came over. My brother and I recognized them now since we had seen them a few times already. We could recognize them from their car pulling into the cul-de-sac we lived in. We knew the protocol. Turn off the lights. Turn the TV volume down so SpongeBob wouldn’t give away our presence. Then we would wait while we silently ate our chicken nuggets. First came the ring, then the knock on the door. Finally after a few minutes we would hear the car drive away. All right, finally that’s over. Now we could go back to watching SpongeBob in peace. Some nerve, coming over here and thinking their religion was superior to everyone else’s. Didn’t they have anything better to do then go around preaching what they thought was the truth? Didn’t everyone think they had the truth? I mean which person follows a religion they think is fake? Just keep your beliefs to yourself please, I can choose for myself what path I want to follow.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The thing was, perhaps I didn’t truly have a path to follow either. But no one really knows if what they believe is actually true, they just choose to believe in what they want. Or so I thought. I held a perspective of God that didn’t quite match any religion. I mean I believed in a God, but not a specific one. Just a God. A God that I thought was good, loving, and apparently a creative genius to have constructed a world such as this one. This is what I assumed after studying science as a young kid before and all throughout high school. Chemistry, Biology, Physics. It was all so crazy to me. How did this stuff all just come together? Random chance? Maybe. I guess you could say that despite the low probability of life forming by itself, you must also take into account that there are quite a bit of possibilities considering the vast size of the universe. Did you know that your body (assuming you’re an adult) contains 7 octillion atoms (you google how many zeros that is) while the Milky Way Galaxy has only around 300-400 billion stars? Do you know that the atoms in your own body are billions of years old? Yeah, you probably do.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Anyways, what I’m trying to say is that I was a theist who loved science. I didn’t really have a particular belief. I just decided that God must have formed this crazy world we call home. How else could all this just come together? Doesn’t a piece of art have to have an artist behind it? So I assumed. I assumed God was real. I assumed that He was the one behind our moral values, that it was He who had instilled in us an ability to distinguish the difference between love and hate. That was what I believed to be a solid foundation for my beliefs. Of course any foundation can appear to be sturdy if the ground beneath it never shakes. And that’s exactly what happened to me my senior year of high school.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The ground shook. I was in Freshman Composition, perhaps one of the more unpleasant classes I’ve had to take as a college student. Way too many essays, and that’s an understatement. For one of our essays we had to choose a topic that was controversial, and then we had to support our stance on it. For some reason, can’t quite remember why, I chose to do a paper on torture. The theme of my paper was if torture could be condoned under certain circumstances. Now at this point in my life, I was already starting to have some doubts about God. I was starting to finally question if He was actually real, or if science could provide a reason for our existence. I mean He didn’t really appear to be here. If He was, then where was He? I couldn’t see Him. Furthermore, I didn’t see Him doing anything for that matter. Couldn’t a God fix all of our problems? What was He doing for a world that seemed to so desperately need His help? I thought about it, but I came up with nothing. Science on the other hand, well that’s a different story. I could go on and on about what advances we have gone through with science, the lives saved, and the new knowledge we’ve discovered that has helped people across the world immensely. To say the least, when I began researching the web for anything that would help me write my paper on torture, the disturbing things I read about left me with some difficult questions.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I believed in a God who could see everything. Who was such a vast being that He could experience everything that went about in this world all at once without losing His mind. What I’m trying to say is that I believed He was omniscient (all knowing), omnipotent (all powerful), and omnipresent (always present). This is when I was forced to deal with the foolish reality of my beliefs. If this God was real, what the hell was He thinking? If I were Him man would things look different in this world. No hunger. No sickness. No crime. Definitely not torture. THAT is what I would do. What was He doing? How could he let people do this to each other? If I was Him and I was all powerful, I would have whipped out my huge thumb and squished a few people I thought the world could do without. That or at least have changed some people in the White House.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I was beginning to finally realize that my belief in God was pretty unrealistic. At least it was unrealistic in the sense that He was a loving God. If He wasn’t, then I didn’t want anything to do with Him anyways. I mean this wasn’t the first time I was forced to read things that were difficult to read. I’ve read plenty of material about torture in the past. I knew about world hunger. I knew more than I think one would need to know about cases of human suffering around the world. But I always somehow managed to keep those thoughts at bay. I was seventeen years of age now, so I guess I wasn’t as immature as my old self. To be honest, probably a bit of a coward was in those old beliefs as well. I was afraid of death, and even more afraid of a life without any meaning. What would be the point of it all? What was the worth of anything I did? Yeah of course I could make you smile, hand you a free ice cream cone and make your day, but you would die anyways too. Were you going to remember anything when it was your time to go six feet under? Nope. Nada. Nothing. Instantly, the world went from a wonderful place of thrilling journeys and experiences to a clock. Tick, tick, tick. And then time would be up. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>What’s the point? I guess we could live for the future generations of humanity. Does that give life enough meaning? I could live for the betterment of society; I could leave the world a better place than it was when I arrived. At least it would be a pleasant place until a couple billion years when the Sun expands into a red giant and becomes a white dwarf. But maybe we would have perfected space travel by then and found another habitable zone. One can always hope right? The way we are currently treating the Earth probably raises bigger concerns than a threat billions of years into the future. But to explore that issue would take a whole other website. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>What I’m trying to say is that I was hopeless. And I didn’t even bother trying to busy myself like most people do. Go to the dance club. Go to valley fair. Go on a Harry Potter marathon or something. Watch some Netflix. Ya know what I mean right? YOLO. That’s the way to go. Hakuna matata, it means no worries. Simba knows what I’m trying to say. Woooooo. Yeah. Nope. I couldn’t do it. I did try of course. I just couldn’t escape the sense of living life with no meaning. No purpose. I had no reason to live. There wasn’t even anywhere else to turn to. And with that, yup you guessed it, came depression. And I’m not talking about a small depression here. I’m talking about a big depression. The kind that’s like, man I don’t give a crap about anything.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Of course with great depression come great changes in facial expressions. So I had to learn how to hide my thoughts. Had to learn to give a fake smile, act like everything was fine. Obviously I didn’t want to talk to anyone. What were they going to tell me, their fake beliefs? That God was real after all, don’t worry your little head about it. And I definitely didn’t want anyone to know that I was depressed. If anyone here reading this knows me personally, they probably know that I’m not a depressed person. I’ve always been this weird kid who always smiles at everything. What’s the point of being sad anyways? You know it takes more energy to be sad than it does to be happy? I think that’s true. Not sure if that’s a fact, but it just feels like it does. So anyways, that’s the end of this depressing story. God’s not real. Thanks for reading. No, I’m just kidding. And I am so glad I don’t have to write about such things because I have something, may I say someone, who is far more valuable and interesting to write about then my own depressing thoughts. Because this is when things began to take a little twist . . .</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I stayed in that depressive state for only a few days. The reason being, that I am now completely convinced of, is that God decided to finally intervene. While I was working something interesting happened. My memory may be failing me a little, but this was the first or second day of me working at the store after my deep state of depression had begun. And this lady came in to the store. There wasn’t anything particularly interesting about her, not to say she wasn’t a kind woman, but she took an item I had rarely seen out of her bag and asked me to package it and send it somewhere. It was a wooden cross of Jesus, one that was quite detailed. It showed the thorns upon His head and His body nailed clearly to the cross. She said to me, “I don’t know exactly why I’m shipping this. I found it a few days ago buried somewhere in my house. It belongs to someone I used to know and I thought I would ship it back to them.” The reason I say this is interesting for me personally is that I was a person who rarely saw a cross. And I am not speaking lightly when I say the word rarely. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>You’re probably like come on kid, you live in America, there’s Christians everywhere. You definitely see that kind of stuff a lot. But, the thing is, I come from a Hindu family. I really don’t actually. Honestly speaking, I had never been to an actual church service. The only crosses I ever saw were the ones I would see mounted on church buildings as I drove by them. In the 3-4 years of this job, this was the first time I had seen one. My ignorance of the Christian religion was actually quite extensive. I didn’t even know that Christians considered Jesus to be God. All I knew was that He had something to do with the Christian religion and that He had died a very painful death on a cross. I didn’t even know the Gospel. You’d of thought by now with all the bible-thumping fellows out there that everyone would have known by now that Jesus died for their sins. Well, for some reason I didn’t. Maybe you’re thinking, didn’t those Jehovah’s Witness people ever tell you. Well yeah, in paper format. They handed me those booklets whenever they saw me, but that doesn’t mean I read them.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>So here is why my depression ended at the time. Not because all my seemingly unanswerable questions were suddenly answered, but because I thought maybe there was some hope after all. Despite my ignorance on the Christian religion, I found it interesting that the cross had just appeared to me by coincidence. The words the lady had said while shipping it was still stuck in my mind. In addition to the lady just having happened to have found it at her house, the cross had also just happened to appear for the first time in my four years of working, right when I desperately needed something to hold onto. I was skeptical, but I was also desperate; so I thought maybe there’s a chance God is real. And so now I had hope. If there’s anything that can get you through hard times, it’s definitely hope. Well that and Netflix. And so what’s next you may ask? Well, the best course of action would have probably been to learn about the Christian religion. Convert. And live happily ever after. But I did things a little differently. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Just a little, I guess. Wow so I’m about to be super open in this post about my life, but hey, you know what they say? Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future. I think it’s important enough that people understand this story for how it really was, otherwise it’s pointless. My first assumption in my thinking process was that God may in fact be real and that He may or may not have sent the cross to me as a sign of proof that He was real. The second assumption in my thinking (more of a conviction really) was that if God was real, then He must also not approve of everything I was doing, and would probably expect me to change some of my habits. So I ignored God. I ignored Him so that I could continue with my own way of living. I would like to think that most people think I’m a pretty “good” kid. And I was. It’s just that I had some addictions that I didn’t quite want to get rid of just yet. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>If there was anything that has ever had a stronghold in my life, it was these two things; pornography and video games. Now the video games, I wasn’t so concerned about. I mean what kind of God cares if I like playing Call of Duty. Or liked spending time leveling up in Halo, or Halo Wars, or Gears of War, or Madden. Yeah, I was a pretty avid gamer you could say. But pornography remained a strong conviction for me. I just knew that it wasn’t right. But that doesn’t mean I was going to stop. The reason being, well as I said before, it was an addiction. It wasn’t just something I did to pass the time. It was, uh what’s the word I’m looking for, oh yeah, an addiction. Addiction: the state of being enslaved to a habit or practice or to something that is psychologically or physically habit-forming. Not one I’m proud of, but it’s true. And so how long was it before I decided to saddle up and give up my pornography addiction. Two months. Two long months of me telling God, (in my head, hoping/assuming that he was real that is) that I would stop soon. That I was going to search for Him when I was ready. And just like any sinful addiction, it has a way of sticking with you longer than you would expect. And so I was finally ready to “search” for Him after about two months of living my own way, when I read something online that deeply resonated with me.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>It was a day when I was finally like; okay I need to stop this. And so I searched onto Google how to stop my pornography addiction. (Haha yeah I did Google this. Heck no, I wasn’t about to pay some weird psychiatrist dude to analyze me. Google would have to do for now.) And it worked by the way. The first site I clicked on came up with, well perhaps you guessed, a Christian website. And all the words on it I have completely forgotten because I didn’t care about what they said. Well, everything except for the words that resonated with me, which I have never forgotten since the day I read them. It is the words Jesus said when he spoke about sin. He said, “Whosoever commits sin, is the servant of sin.” A slave was I? No, not me. I was just living life the way I wanted to live it. Or so I wanted to believe. But truth was, and I finally faced it that day, is that I was a slave to my own lusts. And so with that, I dropped the habit cold turkey and went on a different route instead. A pursuit for the truth. I would have most likely gone back to my old habits, but I didn’t because I replaced them with an eagerness to learn as much as I could about the Christian religion. If Jesus was real, and He was where true freedom could be found, and true meaning for life, then that is where I wanted to start my search for God.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>And so I read. I read and read and read all I could about Christianity. Of course everything I read was online. My family didn’t own a bible, so I learned what I could from random Christian websites. I also ended up reading the book of John from a free website. I learned about the death of Jesus on the cross. I read about His ministry, His healings, His miracles, and His character. He seemed to be the perfect person, if He was real that is. Who knows, this stuff was written like a billion years ago. But one phrase that kept coming up in my searches of Christianity was the two words, “born again.” Apparently if you wanted to become a Christian you had to be born again. What does that even mean? Well apparently, and I know now from my own experiences, most Christians don’t know what this means even though they claim to be born again. There are many pastors out there who are not born again, and many church followers that aren’t.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>When Jesus spoke of being born again, He specifically said that He would send the Holy Spirit to literally live inside you as a witness. That’s what these words mean from John 14:15-21. “If you love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray to the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter (the Holy Spirit), that he may abide with you forever. Even the Spirit of Truth; whom the world cannot receive because they do not see Him or know Him. But you know Him, for he dwells with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you. Yet a little while and the world will no longer see me, but you will see me. Because I live, you also shall live. At that day (meaning the day you’re born again) you shall know that I am in the Father, and you in me, and I in you. He that has my commandments, and keeps them, is he that loves me. And he that loves me shall be loved of my father, and I will love him, and manifest myself to him.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>There are a lot of big promises in that small passage. He specifically says that he will MANIFEST Himself to you. I have had many Christian friends from the past. None of them as far as I know have ever mentioned a Jesus that was living with them personally. None of them mentioned a Holy Spirit that dwelled within their own physical bodies. Perhaps they didn’t understand what the verse meant. I don’t know. Or perhaps they assumed the manifestation of God was not one to be experienced, but was one to be taken by faith. I’m not sure exactly where the division among church goers is, but this is a serious passage that is misunderstood. For if it was properly understood, than most “Christians” would realize they may not in fact be Christians. I’m not trying to be condemning here, though I do realize that’s probably what it may end up sounding like. I’m just trying to explain the deception in the Church and how there are many false teachings around the world regarding Christianity.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Anyways, on with the story. I figured if I could somehow be “born again,” then Jesus would manifest Himself to me. And that’s what I “tried” to do. Be born again. (Though I didn’t quite know how to. I mind as well have been trying to fly after drinking a can of Red Bull.) All I knew was that Jesus told us to repent of our sins, and He would give us the Holy Spirit as a witness, teacher, and comforter. I was going to do my part, repent. And Jesus would have to do His, which was manifest Himself to me. Simple. So I planned out the day I was going to finally put my faith in Christ and be born again.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The day was a Sunday. I was hoping that Jesus was going to fly down from the clouds to accept me or I was never going to believe in anything ever again. I was at home, on my knees, and I began to speak what I was told I was supposed to say. You know that standard sinner’s prayer that everyone says when they get saved? Yeah I said that, thinking that Jesus would magically accept me once I confessed my sins and asked for forgiveness. I said it with an open and honest heart. I thought I meant every word, I was on my knees for God’s sake. And guess what? Nothing. Nothing happened. Here I was on my knees, asking Jesus to take me as I was, and He didn’t show up. The heck is wrong with this guy? I guess that as a seventeen year old I had some pretty big expectations asking the God of the universe to reveal Himself to me. But I wasn’t about to believe and follow Him if He wasn’t real. I had made up my mind that I would not blindly believe in some God who thought He could ask people to have faith in Him when He never even showed Himself to us anywhere.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Such amazing love to die on the cross for my sins but can’t even reveal Himself to me. When I was on my knees too? And I’ve never gotten on my knees for any God before. This was so pointless, asking a God for help when He didn’t even exist. Or so I thought. There’s still more to the story. But at that point I felt so foolish. How gullible to think that a man who lived 2000 years ago preaching that He was God Himself was actually telling the truth. He must have just been a crazy madman who was obsessed with Himself. No wonder why they crucified Him. It didn’t matter now anyways; He was dead. Just like everyone else He had died and never rose again. That point in my life was when I was more broken than I have ever been. My only hope, a man that lived 2000 years ago, was now gone. That was my last, brilliant idea. So what was next?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Well, there was once again no point to life, no meaning, and no hope, so I guess next was another wave of depression, worse than the previous one. And man that sucked. If only I took a selfie of myself at that time for a keepsake. My thinking was so muddled up I wasn’t sure which way was right and which way was left. I knew the Gospel. I repented. Jesus never showed up though. I remember reading this one line from a website that said, “Once you know who Jesus is, you can begin to ask who you are in Him.” Didn’t I know Him though? I mean I knew a lot about Him. I knew His teachings, His miracles, and His personality. Maybe I didn’t quite know Him. I guess to truly know someone you would have to at least meet them first, right?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Well the next few days after I “tried” to be born again were pretty sucky to say the least. Didn’t do much but go to school and come back home and sit around doing nothing; should have tried watching some Netflix, the next best thing after hope. A few days after I had given up on this idea that Jesus was real, I remember going back onto Google just for the heck of it. And I came to a website that was titled, The Seven Words of Jesus on the Cross. And so I read them. But this time when I was reading the words of Jesus on the cross I understood what it really meant. I didn’t just understand the Gospel logically. I mean I basically had it memorized. I’m a sinner and Jesus died for my sins, what’s so hard to understand? But as I was reading the words Jesus said to those who crucified Him, my eyes were opened to the true meaning of the Gospel. Something inside of me just clicked when I read those words.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>“Father, forgive them. For they know not what they do.” I finally understood. Jesus wasn’t just my hope for a life after death. He Himself was hope. He was hope in its truest form. A God, who had come down from His throne to forgive His own creation for abandoning His ways, a creation that had recklessly departed from a world He had originally intended for love and turned it into a world of their own. We took the world He gave us and replaced it with what we liked better. A world replaced with our own jealousy, anger, pride, greed, and lust. Tell me of something He has given us that we have not at some point ruined. He gave us life; we gave Him rebellion. He offered us wisdom; we offered Him a deaf ear. It seems the more sacred the gift, the worse we do. He gave us marriage; we gave Him adultery. But no it gets worse. He gave us His Son; we gave Him crucifixion. Perhaps once, maybe just once He will finally decide to give us what we deserve; justice for our wrongs. Perhaps He will say that since we appear to want nothing to do with Him, He will separate Himself from us for good. But no He doesn’t do that either. He decides to do something much different. He pursues us till the very end. He pursues us till death.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Maybe you’re like, “Hey now, wait a minute… I’ve done some bad things in the past, but I’m certainly not responsible for that last part. I didn’t crucify Jesus. It was those Jews who lived 2000 years ago, not me.” But I think you’re forgetting that Jesus wasn’t on the cross because the Jews decided to crucify Him. Jesus had said Himself that no man had the power to make Him lay down His life, but that He willingly chose to lay it down for our sake. He was not crucified by force. He was crucified by His own love. His own love that was so deep for humanity that He would go to any length to bring us back to Him. He was crucified for our sins. He was crucified for my sins. I was not the one who physically drove those nails into His wrists, but I was the very reason it had to be done. For once I saw the crucifixion of Jesus for what it truly was. He was crucified because of my very own sinful nature. From that revelation I was able to see that it was not only done by me, but it was done for me as well.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p> This is what God did for all of us 2000 years ago. He gave us what we didn’t deserve. He gave us grace. He gave us mercy. He gave us forgiveness. He gave us love. He gave us Himself; His own body was crucified on a cross to symbolize the length He would go to redeem us back to Him. Even if we weren’t yet ready to accept Him, He still had His arms wide open for the time we would be ready to. I finally understood. And with that came a dreadful understanding of what I had done to such a wonderful God. An understanding of whom I actually was compared to the most High God. A God who was so high and lifted up that the angels circling His throne sang, “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole Earth is filled with His glory.” And that is when I finally couldn’t stand. I wasn’t on my knees by choice this time. Rather I was there because my sins were too much for me to bear on my own. I was there because I was too weak to stand before such a God as holy as this.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I distinctly remember this moment. It was on a Thursday, the afternoon of February 23rd, 2012. This was when the Holy Spirit convicted me of my sinfulness beyond what I could bear. For once my pride melted away as I saw myself for who I really was, a sinful man in need of redemption. God’s presence was pressing down on me with such force I was instantly aware of just how real He was. As I was on my knees, I knew without a doubt that He was waiting for what I was about to say. I’m not sure how to describe Him, but His presence was overwhelming. At first, I didn’t know what to say. I was shaking. I knew that He loved me. So I said what I knew needed to be said. I told Him I was sorry. Sorry for everything I had ever done to Him. Sorry for the way I had lived my life. Sorry for the people I had hurt. Sorry for all the wrongs that I could never undo or take back. My sins were now personally between me and God. I knew kneeling in His presence that my sins were the very thing that had caused His heart to mourn. And I had committed so many of them. Even the simplest of things I had thought weren’t that bad like yelling at my younger cousin became a burden I couldn’t bear in the presence of His holiness. For once I was forced to see my sin the way God saw them, and it was not a pretty sight. It was ugly. It was hopeless. But as soon as I had begun to say how sorry I was, I became aware of more than just His great presence. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>His presence enveloped me in what I can only describe as the warmest and most loving embrace I have ever felt. It swept away all the pain; all the guilt and the inescapable feeling of having fallen so short of His standards. It wasn’t just some type of mental emotion in my head. His presence was literally there physically. The only way I can think of describing it is like when you’re coming inside a warm house from a cold winter day and the warmth just sinks into you; except this feeling of immense love and warmth wasn’t from an outside source interacting with my body, but was bursting forth from some deep part within me. This was the love of a savior – redeeming, pure, and selfless. His forgiveness was deeper than knowledge itself. It had no bounds because His love had no place it wouldn’t go for me. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>That is the meaning of the cross. His grace and love was nothing short of a savior who was willing to give up His own life for all of us. Not just to give us an eternal life, but to give us a life with eternal worth. The meaning of the cross is so much more than just salvation. He did it to cleanse us; so that in the glory of His presence we would no longer have to feel ashamed, but that we could stand faultless before His throne. He Himself decided He would restore the intimacy He originally designed for us to have with Him, and He chose to do it through the cross. He vulnerably displayed on the cross the depth of how much He wants a relationship with you. It’s amazing, but it’s also weird. We aren’t used to a love as strong as this; as open, vulnerable, and sacrificial. But it’s true.</p>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>This is when I was born again. I know it, and nothing anyone can say will ever cause me to doubt that Jesus exists. I knew from the moment His overwhelming love swept through me that He had completely forgiven me on that day. I could not even begin to describe the joy and peace that came upon me. I remember just walking into the living room and just thanking Jesus over and over. I couldn’t stop. It was as if this huge, invisible weight I hadn’t even noticed I’d been carrying my whole life had just been lifted off my shoulders. I was free. I was cleansed. I had been made new.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I distinctly remember that I didn’t have the slightest hint of anxiety or fear that day. There was not a shade of disappointment or sadness. It was all just gone, swept away. There was no room for it when I was so filled with the Holy Spirit. It was this crazy sort of peace that I had never before experienced. I remember that I had a BAA basketball game (yeah we all know those can get pretty serious…not really) to go to and I didn’t even care what happened to be honest. I mean I did play hard, I actually stuffed a kid like half a foot taller than me, (I still remember because the audience was in shock when they saw a me somehow jump high enough to stuff this taller white guy) but the game was so small in comparison to what God had done for me that day. Usually I would get really disappointed and angry when we lost (though I would never show it on my face) but that day I didn’t even care when my team lost. I wanted to win, but none of the negative emotions I usually had impacted me. I just decided to play harder next time.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>At home I noticed more and more changes. I know now that it was all the result of the Holy Spirit, and that He was making me a new creation, but at the time I was surprised by how easy it was to just remain at peace. I remember when my mom made food for dinner I would always complain. (My God, was I a complainer when it came to eating food at home…) I was always like, “What there’s no chicken?! We have to eat this same food again?! Not rice again!!!” (We really do eat too much rice.) And I would say all this other random stuff a good mom cooking for her family shouldn’t have to take from her pesky son. But this time I didn’t say a thing. I didn’t even have to try and force myself to not feel tired of eating rice. I was just thankful that she had made dinner for me.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>And so after I ate dinner I went to take a shower. And even though I was sweating from the basketball game, I was like what the heck am I doing this for? I’m already clean. I say that part jokingly but also seriously because that was how deep God’s forgiveness ran inside of me. I felt like the holiest man on the planet.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>So afterwards, I headed over to my brother’s room where the Xbox was. This part requires a little bit of explaining. My cousins and I had formed this sort of tradition where we would play Xbox every day together, right at 9pm sharp. I wanted to explain that part because that day I wasn’t going to play Xbox because I was bored, which was why I usually played it. I was going to play it because it was sort of like an obligation I had to my cousins. Didn’t want to let the fellas down, they needed a good Halo partner. (In Halo 3 I was at lvl 43 in lone wolves, so I was pretty boss at it… just ignore that if you don’t know that means.) So anyways, I turned on my Xbox and went to sign in to my account. When it connected to the internet a large screen showed up and said that my membership had expired and I no longer had a gold account. (Gold was the version of Xbox live that you paid for that let you play online with other people.) Here is the cool thing though. This membership that expired was one I had paid fifty dollars for. It was a pre-paid one year membership for Xbox live meaning that it could only end on one day of the year. I had played Xbox the night before with my cousins (February 22nd, 2012), so the membership had just so happened to end the day that I was born again… I guess Jesus was hitting two birds with one stone. No membership. There goes that second addiction of mine, video games.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I still think about that sometimes. That is pretty crazy. I know there’s probably someone out there saying it was just a coincidence, but you got to admit. That’s pretty cool. There’s three hundred sixty five days in a year. That leaves us with 1/365 = 0.0027397. Pretty slim odds if you ask me. But again, I don’t expect anyone to consider this as proof of God just because the membership ended. That’s completely ridiculous. But what I do want to say is that God will show you many things when you personally follow Him. It may range from physical signs like something similar to the one above; it could be a physical healing, or something spiritual like a manifestation of the Holy Spirit. You do not have to take other’s word for it that God exists. You can see for yourself. Just try not to let pride or a desire to sin get in the way of searching for God like I did.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>So I didn’t end up playing Xbox that day. I don’t really remember what I did but I still remember the amazing experience God gave me at the end of that day. I was getting ready for bed. I had brushed my teeth and everything, and after getting a drink of water I had finally made it to my bed and was ready to get some rest. I had just lay down and pulled the bed covers over me when I felt this huge wave of God’s presence come bursting into the room out of nowhere. It actually happened so quickly and His presence was so overwhelming that I wasn’t sure what was going on. I guess to truly describe it; I had a slight millisecond of being utterly surprised and actually slightly fearful at what I was experiencing because I didn’t know what was going to happen. It felt as if my room was about to collapse on me or something. And then without a moment of hesitation, God’s presence swept over me, but this time stronger than anything I had experienced that day. It was a peace that is truly indescribable. Not even worthy of being compared to where I talked about there being no anxiety or fear. This was a kind of peace that overloaded my entire system. I couldn’t talk. I couldn’t even think. I am convinced that had it not been for me lying in my bed when this happened, say I had been standing up, I would fallen down flat to the ground for sure.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>All I could do was just lay there and enjoy the peace that God gave me. I knew in that moment that He was extremely pleased with what I had done that day. Even though it was as simple and clear cut as confessing Him as savior, I had made a commitment that day to follow Him, and He had made a commitment to never leave me or forsake me. This peace lasted perhaps 7-10 seconds or so, but it didn’t just abruptly end. Instead, I was kind of whisked away into a deep sleep. I distinctly remember that as He gave me that amazing peace, my vision got darker and darker, kind of like a movie fade out. I just fell asleep in a matter of a few seconds from His presence. I remember that night that I didn’t have any dreams at all. I just remember waking up the next day energized and feeling like I was on top of the world. It was the best night of sleep I had ever gotten.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>And that is the end of my testimony of Christ regarding the first day I met Him. Wow that took forever, but to do Him justice I can’t just sum Him up in a few sentences. Though I think perhaps I may have gone a little overboard. I have many other things I could share that God has shown me as I continue to walk with Him, but I don’t want to talk about that right now. I think I’ve talked enough about myself already (though I only do this because I can only be a witness to the things I have experienced, not things others have). But this website isn’t supposed to be about me, it’s supposed to be about Jesus. I am writing this current page about two and a half years after I met Him. I can truly say that He keeps His promises. If you decide to follow Him, He will not forsake you. He will never leave you. I still feel His presence just as clearly as I did that day two and a half years ago. What I wonder most is not if you believe my story, it is if you want to find God for yourself. He rejects no one. The cross is ample evidence of that.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>But many will reject Him. They will reject Him for the simple fact that they do not want Him to be Lord of their lives. People like driving their own cars. We don’t like letting someone else drive our own car for us, especially when we got a pimped out car like a Lamborghini or something. We want to go to the places we want to go, not be led onto a road that may lead us away from our wants, desires, and goals. The irony of it is that we are all searching for something to fulfill that deep part of us, but we all seem to begin our search in the most empty of places. Sometimes the only time we truly decide to give it all up to God is when things get hopeless. When we finally see that what we thought to be driving wasn’t actually a Lambo, but a crappy, old Ford pick-up. But in that revelation we discover our folly in never letting Him lead us in the first place.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>This is Jesus, the One who created the mountains, the rainforests, the oceans, and the stars. Not to mention the lion, the mouse, and the fox. And sugar. He made that too. If you think that you can’t learn anything from this God, then I think you’re a little crazy and over your head. He is the epitome of love, grace, and forgiveness. If we all decided to learn a little more from Him I think we could fix a lot more of the world’s problems. But that’s just my two cents.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>You can lead your own life. It is yours after all. But don’t forget that there was One who paid a steep price to redeem your life. And He didn’t do it because He wanted to control you and be Lord over your life. He did it because He loves you and wants what’s best for you. You were made in His image. You were made for holiness. Many of us have fallen for the lie that the things of God are the least “fun.” We have become a broken society lost in an age of sensuality and selfish pursuits. It is perhaps one of the biggest obstacles that stand in the way of someone coming to know Christ. Will they want to give up their sins in order to follow Christ?  We have all eaten from the tree containing the forbidden fruit, but Jesus is still offering us to come and eat from the tree of life. To taste and see that it is good.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I am aware that there are a large portion of people with a skewed representation of who Jesus really is. There are also many people who think that Christians are just crazy, stupid, and delusional. And in some ways I can’t really blame them because the image of Christ has been ruined, in part, because of the church. We have misrepresented Christ in so many ways, simply because many Christians have not truly come to know Jesus. We are living in a world where Christians are known as Catholics, Lutherans, Baptists, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons . . . what the heck is going on? I thought we were supposed to be one body. You know, the body of Christ, where Jesus is the head? Yet we have all these different beliefs of Jesus each with their own different twists. And on top of this, we have other Christians proclaiming absurdities such as the Earth being only around 6000 years old, sending any rational thinker out the door and further away from Christ. Do not allow your perception of who Jesus is become defined by the way Christians act. It doesn’t make any sense to do this. We are sinners and hypocrites just like everyone else, and we don’t always have all the answers. (Sometimes we aren’t even asking the right questions.) But instead, I urge you to look at the person of Jesus and see if you can find any fault in Him.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The one who loses if you choose to not have a relationship with Him is ultimately you. It is your choice to make. Aren’t we all thirsty? Yet we drink from forbidden waters that we think will taste sweeter instead of drinking from the One who said He Himself was the fountain of life. The One who said if you would drink from the water He gave to you, you would never thirst but would inherit a spring of water that would burst forth into everlasting life.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I know life is busy – school, work, family, friends, parties, football, facebook, twitter. And don’t forget Netflix. But to never get to know Christ, the One by whom all things are being made new, would be in my opinion, one of the worst mistakes one could make. You were made for Him.  There are many out there who don’t realize that they were meant for a one-on-one relationship with the God of the universe. I guess some people like to call this the “God vacuum,” a space that only God can fill. You can settle for the lesser things in life to fill this if you like – money, sex, fame, success . . . Netflix :) But it cannot come close to an intimate relationship with Jesus. And that may be weird and hard to understand because if you don’t know Jesus then you probably don’t understand what’s so great about Him. But get to know Him. He won’t disappoint you.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Don’t get me wrong now. I’m not asking you to go running to the door every time you hear another Jehovah’s Witness ringing your doorbell. I just hope that your life hasn’t become so busy, or your mind hasn’t turned so numb that you can no longer hear the knocking of the Holy Spirit at the door to your heart. He doesn’t even care if your doorbell is working or not, He ain’t gonna stop knocking because He wants to come in. Your heart is locked on the inside not on the outside. Only those you have ever allowed in have a place there. If you so choose to let Him in, I can guarantee this – you will not regret it!</p>
