  <h1>Update</h1>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>So I just wanted to let you know that everything in your last video is 100% accurate and what God has been telling me as well too. I know this. You know this. God knows this. I hope you are not freaking out right now. It will happen. It will take some time, probably 4 years of me running it before I let someone else take over running it, but it will happen. And the revival that will build up after that with the resources we‚Äôre given and how God wants to use that‚Ä¶ oh boy. Let me first explain why 40x2 was such a confirmation to me and made me freak out a little bit. But honestly I‚Äôm not even surprised at this point with how God has been moving. I have zero doubt God‚Äôs hand is all over this season. This is wild. This story is actually truly crazy and is what gave me the confidence to finally message you on 2/2. Again this was me trying to gain your trust by foretelling the future because you can‚Äôt just show up and claim somebody as your wife lol. The original plan was to send you the DM months before publishing the app, kick the company off, and show up and at least prove I was from God and ask you on a date. The plan changed over time, clearly. haha. But this is so much cooler honestly because I get to have you help me through this and experience it with you as well. Maybe not physically, but spiritually and mentally, right?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Here is the 40x2 story. Crazy. Before I went to David‚Äôs church on the day when he was becoming a CoPastor, God gave me the number 40 million a few months in advance. I don‚Äôt know why He gave it to me, I wasn‚Äôt sure. But it‚Äôs the only number I wrote down and He said it was related to the app. I thought it was going to be the amount we got for the first investment round. Then months pass and we arrive on this random Friday. And God tells me, normally you don‚Äôt go to church on Sunday (Saturday services at River Valley is what I would do every once in a while) but this Sunday we are going to church and you need to cancel your plans. And so I did, but I didn‚Äôt know where I was going, I thought maybe I was going to my local church nearby. Then come Saturday, I hangout with David, and I shared my testimony of everything I was experiencing for the first time with him. Because I told him I need prayer and this is insane and feels like prosperity gospel and every part of me knew it was the truth but a small part of me worried I was following a deceitful spirit. Anyways, tell him the entire story and say if this all works out, you are not going to be working anymore. You are going to be a full-time Jesus person. And I‚Äôll provide the funds. But if it doesn‚Äôt work out, please just submit me to a mental clinic because I have no idea what is going on with my life right now, it‚Äôs too crazy. After we are done hanging out, David says oh yeah I‚Äôm getting co-pastored in and invites me to his church. Confirmation there. That‚Äôs why God said cancel your Sunday plans.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>That same night He tells me to rewatch your video with the Gold Duck, Cherry Blossoms, and Snowball. Again, idk why, I just do what He says lol. Then the next day at church, Sunday David gets co-pastored in. Gives a little speech. 2 others became a CoPastor with him that same day. And then the service is over. I was talking to some other people in the crowd while David was up front. The other co-pastors were up front as well. And then God says, stop talking to who you‚Äôre with and go talk to David. I make my way up to the front and talk to David and his wife for a few minutes, and this lady comes up to us. Out of all 3 of them, she came up to David. And she seems very serious and she says I have a prophetic word for you David. And so I turn to leave because this word was not for me, it‚Äôs for David and I didn‚Äôt want to intervene. But then she turns and looks at me and says, ‚ÄúNo. You stay. You‚Äôre the witness.‚Äù </p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>And she has David hold out his hand and then she has his wife hold out her hand on top of his. And she places two twenty dollar bills in both of their hands. And she says this here is $40. For every dollar I give you, the Lord is going to give you 1 million dollars. 40 million dollars the Lord will give to you.‚Äù</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>And then she leaves and David and I turn to each other because at that moment the Holy Spirit hit us like a ton of bricks. Because just yesterday we were talking about how if all this worked out, he wouldn‚Äôt be working a job while pastoring because I would support his ministry. And the crazy part of all this is that she looked at me and said I was the witness. And guess what I had written own in my phone? And in that moment I opened my phone up and showed them all the stuff I kept that God had given me, and I only had one number written down in there and it basically just said ‚Äú40mil???‚Äù It was so messed up. One of the craziest things I have ever experienced of the Holy Spirit basically saying, yeah this is happening brother. Start believing it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Here are my thoughts. Because this is not about the money obviously, but I am excited because I know this is the first initial steps that is needed to start all this. Like you said, battle against good and evil. What takes place after this foundation is laid is what He has groomed me for these past 12 years. And you as well, for the years you were with Him, and just your entire life is a testimony of your resilience. And we are going to need lots of that. The amount of faith this requires previously made me feel crazy. For me, you were that last piece I needed. Like when Peter Pan finally starts flying and has full faith. That‚Äôs the stage we are entering here. When you gave me the confirmation I needed, and that 12 year promise was fulfilled‚Ä¶ Idk how to explain it. I am such a different person right now. I did so much healing the past few days.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>This is the real me. Can you tell I‚Äôm back to myself? When you first gave that final confirmation, you put my body into a state of shock. Like I think I had an adrenaline dump that lasted two days. I felt nothing and I asked God why. Didn‚Äôt sleep or eat much, stomach went into knots. But then it passed and eventually I did start feeling. And it was a lot. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Like I think there was a small bucket filled with salt water over here somewhere. üíÄ</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Major healing took place. It‚Äôs crazy what a wait period like that can do to make you question your entire relationship with God. That was probably the hardest part of all of this. I felt like I lost Him for a bit there. I did lose Him for a bit, and He was the most important thing in my life. I honestly at moments didn‚Äôt even know if He existed or not. There was a span of years where He stopped giving me signs of Him in ways like I am seeing them now. And He tested me to the point where I realized and felt like I was just a project to Him. And I told Him this. And as it was happening a small part of me knew He was doing this to me on purpose. Whenever I wanted to quit because I was being driven insane, He would say in a small voice, you will wish I didn‚Äôt tell you ahead of your time, keep going.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Because this waiting season was key to instill confidence in myself that I did do my waiting. The same way Abraham did his waiting, the same way Moses or Joseph did his waiting, I did mine. And because of this, it was accounted to them as righteousness. All the things God is going to have me do, you do, is enough to make anyone feel like an imposter. But God is saying you passed these trials. And this is the place where I am putting you guys. Here is where we are going.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The thing God has put on my heart this season is front and center. He told me to sit at the front spot at River Valley Church (Apple Valley) one day a few months back but I sat in the back instead. I already knew it was symbolic of what He was trying to tell me. It wasn‚Äôt that I was supposed to go talk to anyone there. It was because the next visit I made to a church was another church where I had to sit next to my friend who was becoming a CoPastor. This time I was ‚Äúforced‚Äù to sit next to him. And this time I happened to be in the front row at the center of it. And right in front of me was a microphone.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Here is what God was telling me. All my life I have taken a back seat. For 30 years I did that, even though I always kind of had this weird knowing inside of me that He was preparing and shaping me for something big. When this foundation is done being laid, and the time is right, I will take my spot. And you will have to as well. Because God called us to do so. And it is front and center. Believe me, there is nobody that will be doing the things we will be doing. And I‚Äôm not saying this out of ego, this is just the truth. These are facts. Let them doubt. Watch it happen. We are not called to the front-right, or the front-left, or the 2nd row. We are called to the front, and we are called to the center. That is how He plans on using us. He is going to use us in crazy ways‚Ä¶ and so many of His other children will be elevated in this season as well in many ways, I‚Äôm sure of that. But how beautiful is that? That He is coming back for His children. In a way we can‚Äôt even begin to comprehend right now, He is going to bring about a revival. And I have seen it. The Moses video you made. I saw that dream. And I saw my spot, given to me by God with His authority. And it was more than what any man had on the Earth at that time. And I saw the explosion. So many lost souls. More than could be even counted is what God showed me. FOUND. Brought back to the love of Jesus Christ.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>He is so good. He is so good. He is so good.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I know this is a lot. I was honestly a bit worried about how you felt about this, so I decided to write some stuff. But maybe I am underestimating you again. You can let me know how you‚Äôre feeling, but you seemed pretty excited which is good. When I first received this it took me a lot of time to digest. And it was heavy heavy.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>And I am taking all this in with as much as a humble heart as I can. He worked with me a lot the past few days. Again I healed so much. I held onto so much because I had to build up this proof of evidence around me because I felt like a liar for so long. There is a long term plan. I know all the major details, but honestly it‚Äôs almost as if you have helped me sort through all the details in between the major ones. It‚Äôs crazy. Like do this, do that, don‚Äôt forget to do this. It‚Äôs a woman‚Äôs intuition I swear. And you‚Äôve also confirmed every major detail God told me I would be doing. I don‚Äôt think you realized when you were saying it at the time. But yes, every single one. You confirmed it. I don‚Äôt even understand you. But I like you. A lot obviously lol.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>We are being given the opportunity to do a lot. I need you to expect more than whatever it is you are expecting. I was in tears the other day explaining to David the places this eventually leads. It truly is going to be insane. The understanding I‚Äôve been given though is as this foundation is being laid (the company, the resources to be the hands and feet of Jesus to the world) we will eventually transition to the mouth/microphone when this ministry starts down the road. During that time we will kind of have a ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù but still like an all out living for Jesus life. Like a normal life as in getting our life back lol. I mean I know with Jesus you have all that you need now, but you know what I mean. I know the feeling. When step three happens ‚Ä¶ 20, maybe 25 years from now‚Ä¶ that will not be a normal life. Like not even close. That will be where we will be called into service like no other. And I will bear most of that burden, but you most definitely will bear a chunk of it with me. And God only knows what we may have to go through but I will not be able to do that alone. It is scary but I am starting to realize with Him we can do anything. I just wonder how much we will be tried during that time. It is going to be a lot. And that is why we are going to need to trust each other more than anything. Before I felt like I was carrying the world on my shoulders as I built this app because I knew where all this was heading towards. I had the Moses dream in February and that raised the stakes. He has been reminding me to hand things over to Him. Relax, one step at a time. I‚Äôm with you. I‚Äôm starting to have a different perspective and I‚Äôm finally starting to get more excited. Like you said. It is done. It is already done. My life is a movie. And so is yours.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Before I fully knew my purpose but I had the inklings of what I was going to be doing, I kept asking God who is this woman going to be? She is going to have to live in my shadow lol if you want me to do all of this God. But you turned out just as I had expected. Fierce, confident, and a humble heart. I saw you and I‚Äôm like, yup that‚Äôs her. Believe me, I know you‚Äôre not perfect, I‚Äôm not trying to hype you up. We both are imperfect beings. But we are both willing, and we are both obedient. And that is what‚Äôs key. We‚Äôre going to be so good for each other, it‚Äôs actually insane. Like iron sharpens iron we will continue to sharpen each other. Not just spiritually. There are things we are going to bring out in each other that will be needed. Skills that are going to be needed for running organizations, charities, etc. You will be apart of all this. You know how some men they just want someone who is like their nice trophy wife on the side? I‚Äôm the complete opposite. Because I know where you are heading, and God has such high expectations for you and so do I. There will be skills you will have to learn along the way, and you will reinvent yourself probably multiple times as we go through these seasons but it‚Äôs going to be so worth it. And I‚Äôll help you along the way too :) We‚Äôll figure it out. I mean you‚Äôre already doing it now with what you‚Äôre doing. You‚Äôre being prepared for a stage. Believe it or not, that day will come. And their will be a microphone placed in front of you where you will reach more than whom you are reaching now.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>It is crazy right now that this company is starting off with just me as the founder. But that is how God wants it, because that means I get to control most of the equity. And I need to have incredible discernment because as we get the first round of investing (which usually you can bring people to the table with 100,000 users easily if you have a high growth rate) this will be the first funding seed needed to pull a team together. I already have a few people I know on standby whom I trust that is going to join when this kicks off. My brother is 100% in when needed. And some I will have to go looking for or God will bring to me. I know He is working in the background. He brought someone back into my life from many years ago. An old UofM friend who is a professional software engineer who I trust very much. I believe he will be joining once I get that funding. And with a small team we will continue to expand on features, get the Android side built which is going to be way easier than how long it took me to get the iOS one built. It took me 2 years for just building, but I was designing it during this time to, figuring out how to code, etc. This idea has been on my heart for like 5 years I believe. And I finally worked up the courage to do it. The thing that turned me around was as I was driving one day, putting it off, He told me. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt start now, it will be too late.‚Äù And it was a heavy word. And so I did. I started working basically 70-80 hr weeks. Building this on the side while working my real job.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>But anyways, as this thing continues to grow (snowball), we will have another investing round. And another, until there is a certain percentage owned by me (the founder), some percentage for the starting team that kicked it off (co-founders), some for advisors (people who helped kind of steer us through decision making, investing rounds, etc.) and for investors whether thats angel investors on that first round or VC in later, bigger stages.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>This is all so crazy. It seems impossible. But I have a million features in my head to instill in this app, I just don‚Äôt physically have enough time to do it on my own. I need help and I need people. I did a lot on my own. And this wouldn‚Äôt even be possible back in the day for one person to do. It is only possible today now because of things like ChatGPT, Google Cloud Platform for the backend database, SwiftUI built by Apple for easier coding. I sound like such a nerd right now, wow. I had to learn so much crap to get here lol. Literally killed myself to get here to this moment. But God called me to re-invent myself. Was a bio-chemical engineer but learned coding later on when God put this dream in my heart. Looking back now I know it was all Him.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I have so many things I want to share with you on how we got here, but also how far we still have to go. But those are discussions to be had in person. And some parts of it are light and fun, some of it inspiring, and some of it heavy but exciting? I think. So we will be blessed a lot but we will be tried a lot too. This is a long road. That‚Äôs partly why I think God made us 8 years part. Imagine doing the company and you were 30 and we wanted to have kids. Would be a nightmare. Would need a few years to kick this thing off. Initially getting this plane off the runway is 70-80 hrs of work a week. And today is my last day off that I feel I have been called to take (you know just recovering from a 12 year depression and all, no biggie) also my birthday today! And then Monday, you said it yourself. The slingshot is starting. And we are going to start moving. I probably have estimated anywhere from 40-80 hrs left to finalize things, test everything out on the final production server with a few friends of mine, and then submit it for approval on the Apple App Store.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>And what God has told me is the first half of the year I have been working diligently. He is going to take over the 2nd half of the year. How cool is that lol. He gave me a word. He is so dramatic sometimes. He said, ‚ÄúExpect Me‚Äù lol. Like you think I‚Äôm not going to show up after you did all this work and I told you all the plans I have for you. Heck no, He is going to show up and He is going to show up hard. I know that. I wonder what kind of issues I will have with deployment and advertising and everything else but I know He is going to work it out with me. And there is somewhat of a rough plan for advertising. I‚Äôm working with a church here as well that has about 10,000 people across the nation that attend it. They may be able to help in giving this an initial user count boost. I‚Äôm not 100% on this, but I believe God told me the other day that by the end of 2025, we can expect like 200,000-300,000 users total for the app. But that by next year sometime it would be over like +10-20 million users??? Idk, wild. That‚Äôs just what I believe He told me. But regardless, leaving the numbers behind, I can feel this thing heavy in my bones. I know this is happening. The same way I felt the Holy Spirit tell me my wife was going to show up (which for the first time in 12 years I felt a few months prior before I came across your profile on Tik Tok)‚Ä¶that‚Äôs a whole other story.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>And all this time I had these dreams in my heart, all these crazy things God told me to do, and I had just barely enough faith to move forward and believe something good was going to hopefully come from it. And eventually it did. And I felt crazy the entire time doing it because of this 12 year promise that was unfulfilled. But now I know exactly who I am. And exactly where I am going. And you need to have that certainty too. Like you said, there is no room for doubt in this season.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>If you are having any doubts about how big this can get. I want you to imagine something for a second. Because the initial released version will not look like a billion dollar company lol, but this vision here is the end goal of the app. Imagine there was an app you could open up, that all your friends had a profile on, where you could easily see what they were up to that weekend, things they had invited you to, access to groups whether that‚Äôs your church group or university friends, softball team, whatever, etc. And then most importantly, there was a large network of streamlined things you can do in your local area from different places. Whether that be a restaurant, a paintball park, festival event, etc. That is the entire end goal of the app. But to make it so user friendly so it isn‚Äôt annoying because a lot of hangout apps are annoying and charge for a subscription. Most of these currently existing hangout apps nobody uses them. Because why use it when you can just send your friend a text? The features you make on it have to add enough value and should be just as quick as sending a text to your friends. Otherwise why use it?And if the vision that I have in my mind comes to pass, it‚Äôs actually a super cool idea. Like crazy cool. And it will take it to that next level. The exact prophecy I heard at church that was wild was when a speaker showed up and said, (and this was 5 seconds after I had asked God for a sign for why I should keep going and I needed SOMETHING to cling onto, because I was still waiting for you at the time and I felt completely lost, was asking Him for a word about you, He gave a different word instead about the app lol, unreal) This man who was speaking said, ‚ÄúI know this is going to sound crazy, but God is telling me that the next Mark Zuckerberg is in our church.‚Äù This was at River Valley. And I was stunned, like the Holy Spirit hit me in that moment the same way He hit me with the 40x2 story. But my faith in Him was still so doubtful because again, the waiting period had me saying God you are so full of sh*t (this was honestly my attitude at the time) to be telling me all these things while you didn‚Äôt even do the first thing you told me you would do so many years ago. You can‚Äôt even find this person for me but you are telling me all this and expect me to believe it too? And I said no this isn‚Äôt for me. But then I had to admit, in a crowd of 300-400 people who were in that room when this was spoken, how many of them could actually build an entire app? And if they did, how many of them were building a social media one? Very unlikely.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>And so here we are. And every step of the way I followed my intuition as best I could because I wanted to believe I wasn‚Äôt waiting for nothing. And that I had some purpose to my life even though I felt like there was nothing. And it was at 30 that this happened sometime in 2024. And I still didn‚Äôt fully believe it even after the craziest stuff would happen to me. One day I told God as I was wrestling with Him, ‚ÄúLook I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing. Even if this is true, how am I even going to do this.‚Äù And then I opened up a book I had on my counter and the first words my eyes saw were, ‚ÄúWhen Zuckerburg was just starting to scale his company and panicked, he was like ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know how to do this.‚Äô And he called Jim Bayer [venture capitalist and founder of Accel Partners]. ‚ÄòWell I have this really great head of product at this other company, and you need this person.‚Äô‚Äù Page 82 of A guide to wealth and happiness - The Almanack of Naval Ravikant. And later in January I had a dream of the funding I would receive symbolically, and it was like told that I would look like someone who people thought was too inexperienced but he just kept receiving more and more haha. And that book thing you do? Where you open to a random page. Yeah I do it too. I could recognize you from a million miles away lol. We don‚Äôt have the same backgrounds but our relationship with God, I swear we are like the same person, we‚Äôre just in different bodies haha. And across the country.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I keep saying the word crazy but what other word is there for it? Lot of the revelation I got came in 2025. But you need to know that the videos you made at the end of 2024 were so clutch lol. I was pulled out of the TRENCHES. God is a creative genius, and He has weaved our stories together. And He is going to continue to do so. The fact that you recognized me without much of anything to go off of. Just comments and the Holy Ghost. Are you freakin kidding me. Imagine when we are together lol. The best thing in the world is to be understood. And I‚Äôm so glad I found that. Like you, without having to leave my doorstep I found that, because God brought you right to me. The best things that are meant for you will find you, you won‚Äôt have to go looking for them. We are going to be called to have a level of commitment to the Lord, and to each other that can move mountains. And we will move mountains. God will use so many of His children during this time that want to be obedient. There is a storm coming, and it is going to sweep the nation. Just a matter of time :)</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>This took me a while to write lol. But it‚Äôs fine God did not call me to work today. This is my last day off and then it‚Äôs go time again. I think we are setting a good pace right now with communication. I am following my discernment. I‚Äôm happy. You look a happy too. I just keep thanking God over and over. I can‚Äôt really stop doing it. He is incredible.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I hope you understand why I am hidden right now, at least publicly I‚Äôm a ghost. Because if people heard this story they would think I was crazy and that would effect investments and all other sorts of things that I probably can‚Äôt forsee right now. But I believe God has told me this is important to be hidden. It‚Äôs fine. But when this foundation is laid, I will come out and be crazy. Unfortunately in this world, money is power. And God is handing that over to us so that nobody will have a hold on the future things we have to do. And we will hop from one thing to the next because we are here to spark a revival. I don‚Äôt care if people think I‚Äôm crazy that‚Äôs what God told me we are here to do. We are the spark. We are the front and center. Yes many other Christians are involved in this. But we are called to lead it. That is crazy. Believe it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Thats a lot. Intense stuff lol. On a side note, you think I should get my passport? Idk if I‚Äôm going to be able to travel this year when building this company‚Ä¶ maybe I‚Äôll get it anyways. Can‚Äôt hurt. You probably will travel though when I lock in this first investment lol. Too much to think about and too much going on in my head. Don‚Äôt make me jealous and send me pictures on the beach now‚Ä¶</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>And thanks for doing what you do. I told you a 100x by now, but I appreciate all your videos. Get‚Äôs me pumped up lol. REVIVAL. JESUS. HAPPY FEET. BEARS, BEETS, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA"</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>This portion I'll probably end up taking down eventually. Will leave it for a few days.</p>

  <h1>My Testimony</h1>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I wrote this back when I was 20 years old or so. It was like 2 years or so after meeting Mr. J</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>It‚Äôs kind of funny how life works out sometimes. I remember when I was very young, around the time I was in middle school, and me and my brother would end up staying at home alone in the Summer while my parents were at work. It was a pretty chill time. Back then most of my life consisted of watching SpongeBob and eating chicken nuggets. That George Foreman grill never did fail us. We were only interrupted at times when random people would ring our doorbell. They were probably just folks trying to sell something to us. We wouldn‚Äôt answer obviously. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want what you‚Äôre selling!‚Äù Ok, we didn‚Äôt actually yell that, but maybe if we did they would have gone away faster. But of course it didn‚Äôt end there. They would think that for some reason the doorbell was broken or malfunctioning, and then they would begin to knock on the door over and over. My gosh do these people ever give up?</p>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I remember the funniest moments would be when the Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses came over. My brother and I recognized them now since we had seen them a few times already. We could recognize them from their car pulling into the cul-de-sac we lived in. We knew the protocol. Turn off the lights. Turn the TV volume down so SpongeBob wouldn‚Äôt give away our presence. Then we would wait while we silently ate our chicken nuggets. First came the ring, then the knock on the door. Finally after a few minutes we would hear the car drive away. All right, finally that‚Äôs over. Now we could go back to watching SpongeBob in peace. Some nerve, coming over here and thinking their religion was superior to everyone else‚Äôs. Didn‚Äôt they have anything better to do then go around preaching what they thought was the truth? Didn‚Äôt everyone think they had the truth? I mean which person follows a religion they think is fake? Just keep your beliefs to yourself please, I can choose for myself what path I want to follow.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The thing was, perhaps I didn‚Äôt truly have a path to follow either. But no one really knows if what they believe is actually true, they just choose to believe in what they want. Or so I thought. I held a perspective of God that didn‚Äôt quite match any religion. I mean I believed in a God, but not a specific one. Just a God. A God that I thought was good, loving, and apparently a creative genius to have constructed a world such as this one. This is what I assumed after studying science as a young kid before and all throughout high school. Chemistry, Biology, Physics. It was all so crazy to me. How did this stuff all just come together? Random chance? Maybe. I guess you could say that despite the low probability of life forming by itself, you must also take into account that there are quite a bit of possibilities considering the vast size of the universe. Did you know that your body (assuming you‚Äôre an adult) contains 7 octillion atoms (you google how many zeros that is) while the Milky Way Galaxy has only around 300-400 billion stars? Do you know that the atoms in your own body are billions of years old? Yeah, you probably do.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Anyways, what I‚Äôm trying to say is that I was a theist who loved science. I didn‚Äôt really have a particular belief. I just decided that God must have formed this crazy world we call home. How else could all this just come together? Doesn‚Äôt a piece of art have to have an artist behind it? So I assumed. I assumed God was real. I assumed that He was the one behind our moral values, that it was He who had instilled in us an ability to distinguish the difference between love and hate. That was what I believed to be a solid foundation for my beliefs. Of course any foundation can appear to be sturdy if the ground beneath it never shakes. And that‚Äôs exactly what happened to me my senior year of high school.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The ground shook. I was in Freshman Composition, perhaps one of the more unpleasant classes I‚Äôve had to take as a college student. Way too many essays, and that‚Äôs an understatement. For one of our essays we had to choose a topic that was controversial, and then we had to support our stance on it. For some reason, can‚Äôt quite remember why, I chose to do a paper on torture. The theme of my paper was if torture could be condoned under certain circumstances. Now at this point in my life, I was already starting to have some doubts about God. I was starting to finally question if He was actually real, or if science could provide a reason for our existence. I mean He didn‚Äôt really appear to be here. If He was, then where was He? I couldn‚Äôt see Him. Furthermore, I didn‚Äôt see Him doing anything for that matter. Couldn‚Äôt a God fix all of our problems? What was He doing for a world that seemed to so desperately need His help? I thought about it, but I came up with nothing. Science on the other hand, well that‚Äôs a different story. I could go on and on about what advances we have gone through with science, the lives saved, and the new knowledge we‚Äôve discovered that has helped people across the world immensely. To say the least, when I began researching the web for anything that would help me write my paper on torture, the disturbing things I read about left me with some difficult questions.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I believed in a God who could see everything. Who was such a vast being that He could experience everything that went about in this world all at once without losing His mind. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that I believed He was omniscient (all knowing), omnipotent (all powerful), and omnipresent (always present). This is when I was forced to deal with the foolish reality of my beliefs. If this God was real, what the hell was He thinking? If I were Him man would things look different in this world. No hunger. No sickness. No crime. Definitely not torture. THAT is what I would do. What was He doing? How could he let people do this to each other? If I was Him and I was all powerful, I would have whipped out my huge thumb and squished a few people I thought the world could do without. That or at least have changed some people in the White House.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I was beginning to finally realize that my belief in God was pretty unrealistic. At least it was unrealistic in the sense that He was a loving God. If He wasn‚Äôt, then I didn‚Äôt want anything to do with Him anyways. I mean this wasn‚Äôt the first time I was forced to read things that were difficult to read. I‚Äôve read plenty of material about torture in the past. I knew about world hunger. I knew more than I think one would need to know about cases of human suffering around the world. But I always somehow managed to keep those thoughts at bay. I was seventeen years of age now, so I guess I wasn‚Äôt as immature as my old self. To be honest, probably a bit of a coward was in those old beliefs as well. I was afraid of death, and even more afraid of a life without any meaning. What would be the point of it all? What was the worth of anything I did? Yeah of course I could make you smile, hand you a free ice cream cone and make your day, but you would die anyways too. Were you going to remember anything when it was your time to go six feet under? Nope. Nada. Nothing. Instantly, the world went from a wonderful place of thrilling journeys and experiences to a clock. Tick, tick, tick. And then time would be up. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>What‚Äôs the point? I guess we could live for the future generations of humanity. Does that give life enough meaning? I could live for the betterment of society; I could leave the world a better place than it was when I arrived. At least it would be a pleasant place until a couple billion years when the Sun expands into a red giant and becomes a white dwarf. But maybe we would have perfected space travel by then and found another habitable zone. One can always hope right? The way we are currently treating the Earth probably raises bigger concerns than a threat billions of years into the future. But to explore that issue would take a whole other website. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>What I‚Äôm trying to say is that I was hopeless. And I didn‚Äôt even bother trying to busy myself like most people do. Go to the dance club. Go to valley fair. Go on a Harry Potter marathon or something. Watch some Netflix. Ya know what I mean right? YOLO. That‚Äôs the way to go. Hakuna matata, it means no worries. Simba knows what I‚Äôm trying to say. Woooooo. Yeah. Nope. I couldn‚Äôt do it. I did try of course. I just couldn‚Äôt escape the sense of living life with no meaning. No purpose. I had no reason to live. There wasn‚Äôt even anywhere else to turn to. And with that, yup you guessed it, came depression. And I‚Äôm not talking about a small depression here. I‚Äôm talking about a big depression. The kind that‚Äôs like, man I don‚Äôt give a crap about anything.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Of course with great depression come great changes in facial expressions. So I had to learn how to hide my thoughts. Had to learn to give a fake smile, act like everything was fine. Obviously I didn‚Äôt want to talk to anyone. What were they going to tell me, their fake beliefs? That God was real after all, don‚Äôt worry your little head about it. And I definitely didn‚Äôt want anyone to know that I was depressed. If anyone here reading this knows me personally, they probably know that I‚Äôm not a depressed person. I‚Äôve always been this weird kid who always smiles at everything. What‚Äôs the point of being sad anyways? You know it takes more energy to be sad than it does to be happy? I think that‚Äôs true. Not sure if that‚Äôs a fact, but it just feels like it does. So anyways, that‚Äôs the end of this depressing story. God‚Äôs not real. Thanks for reading. No, I‚Äôm just kidding. And I am so glad I don‚Äôt have to write about such things because I have something, may I say someone, who is far more valuable and interesting to write about then my own depressing thoughts. Because this is when things began to take a little twist . . .</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I stayed in that depressive state for only a few days. The reason being, that I am now completely convinced of, is that God decided to finally intervene. While I was working something interesting happened. My memory may be failing me a little, but this was the first or second day of me working at the store after my deep state of depression had begun. And this lady came in to the store. There wasn‚Äôt anything particularly interesting about her, not to say she wasn‚Äôt a kind woman, but she took an item I had rarely seen out of her bag and asked me to package it and send it somewhere. It was a wooden cross of Jesus, one that was quite detailed. It showed the thorns upon His head and His body nailed clearly to the cross. She said to me, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know exactly why I‚Äôm shipping this. I found it a few days ago buried somewhere in my house. It belongs to someone I used to know and I thought I would ship it back to them.‚Äù The reason I say this is interesting for me personally is that I was a person who rarely saw a cross. And I am not speaking lightly when I say the word rarely. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>You‚Äôre probably like come on kid, you live in America, there‚Äôs Christians everywhere. You definitely see that kind of stuff a lot. But, the thing is, I come from a Hindu family. I really don‚Äôt actually. Honestly speaking, I had never been to an actual church service. The only crosses I ever saw were the ones I would see mounted on church buildings as I drove by them. In the 3-4 years of this job, this was the first time I had seen one. My ignorance of the Christian religion was actually quite extensive. I didn‚Äôt even know that Christians considered Jesus to be God. All I knew was that He had something to do with the Christian religion and that He had died a very painful death on a cross. I didn‚Äôt even know the Gospel. You‚Äôd of thought by now with all the bible-thumping fellows out there that everyone would have known by now that Jesus died for their sins. Well, for some reason I didn‚Äôt. Maybe you‚Äôre thinking, didn‚Äôt those Jehovah‚Äôs Witness people ever tell you. Well yeah, in paper format. They handed me those booklets whenever they saw me, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I read them.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>So here is why my depression ended at the time. Not because all my seemingly unanswerable questions were suddenly answered, but because I thought maybe there was some hope after all. Despite my ignorance on the Christian religion, I found it interesting that the cross had just appeared to me by coincidence. The words the lady had said while shipping it was still stuck in my mind. In addition to the lady just having happened to have found it at her house, the cross had also just happened to appear for the first time in my four years of working, right when I desperately needed something to hold onto. I was skeptical, but I was also desperate; so I thought maybe there‚Äôs a chance God is real. And so now I had hope. If there‚Äôs anything that can get you through hard times, it‚Äôs definitely hope. Well that and Netflix. And so what‚Äôs next you may ask? Well, the best course of action would have probably been to learn about the Christian religion. Convert. And live happily ever after. But I did things a little differently. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Just a little, I guess. Wow so I‚Äôm about to be super open in this post about my life, but hey, you know what they say? Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future. I think it‚Äôs important enough that people understand this story for how it really was, otherwise it‚Äôs pointless. My first assumption in my thinking process was that God may in fact be real and that He may or may not have sent the cross to me as a sign of proof that He was real. The second assumption in my thinking (more of a conviction really) was that if God was real, then He must also not approve of everything I was doing, and would probably expect me to change some of my habits. So I ignored God. I ignored Him so that I could continue with my own way of living. I would like to think that most people think I‚Äôm a pretty ‚Äúgood‚Äù kid. And I was. It‚Äôs just that I had some addictions that I didn‚Äôt quite want to get rid of just yet. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>If there was anything that has ever had a stronghold in my life, it was these two things; pornography and video games. Now the video games, I wasn‚Äôt so concerned about. I mean what kind of God cares if I like playing Call of Duty. Or liked spending time leveling up in Halo, or Halo Wars, or Gears of War, or Madden. Yeah, I was a pretty avid gamer you could say. But pornography remained a strong conviction for me. I just knew that it wasn‚Äôt right. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I was going to stop. The reason being, well as I said before, it was an addiction. It wasn‚Äôt just something I did to pass the time. It was, uh what‚Äôs the word I‚Äôm looking for, oh yeah, an addiction. Addiction: the state of being enslaved to a habit or practice or to something that is psychologically or physically habit-forming. Not one I‚Äôm proud of, but it‚Äôs true. And so how long was it before I decided to saddle up and give up my pornography addiction. Two months. Two long months of me telling God, (in my head, hoping/assuming that he was real that is) that I would stop soon. That I was going to search for Him when I was ready. And just like any sinful addiction, it has a way of sticking with you longer than you would expect. And so I was finally ready to ‚Äúsearch‚Äù for Him after about two months of living my own way, when I read something online that deeply resonated with me.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>It was a day when I was finally like; okay I need to stop this. And so I searched onto Google how to stop my pornography addiction. (Haha yeah I did Google this. Heck no, I wasn‚Äôt about to pay some weird psychiatrist dude to analyze me. Google would have to do for now.) And it worked by the way. The first site I clicked on came up with, well perhaps you guessed, a Christian website. And all the words on it I have completely forgotten because I didn‚Äôt care about what they said. Well, everything except for the words that resonated with me, which I have never forgotten since the day I read them. It is the words Jesus said when he spoke about sin. He said, ‚ÄúWhosoever commits sin, is the servant of sin.‚Äù A slave was I? No, not me. I was just living life the way I wanted to live it. Or so I wanted to believe. But truth was, and I finally faced it that day, is that I was a slave to my own lusts. And so with that, I dropped the habit cold turkey and went on a different route instead. A pursuit for the truth. I would have most likely gone back to my old habits, but I didn‚Äôt because I replaced them with an eagerness to learn as much as I could about the Christian religion. If Jesus was real, and He was where true freedom could be found, and true meaning for life, then that is where I wanted to start my search for God.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>And so I read. I read and read and read all I could about Christianity. Of course everything I read was online. My family didn‚Äôt own a bible, so I learned what I could from random Christian websites. I also ended up reading the book of John from a free website. I learned about the death of Jesus on the cross. I read about His ministry, His healings, His miracles, and His character. He seemed to be the perfect person, if He was real that is. Who knows, this stuff was written like a billion years ago. But one phrase that kept coming up in my searches of Christianity was the two words, ‚Äúborn again.‚Äù Apparently if you wanted to become a Christian you had to be born again. What does that even mean? Well apparently, and I know now from my own experiences, most Christians don‚Äôt know what this means even though they claim to be born again. There are many pastors out there who are not born again, and many church followers that aren‚Äôt.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>When Jesus spoke of being born again, He specifically said that He would send the Holy Spirit to literally live inside you as a witness. That‚Äôs what these words mean from John 14:15-21. ‚ÄúIf you love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray to the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter (the Holy Spirit), that he may abide with you forever. Even the Spirit of Truth; whom the world cannot receive because they do not see Him or know Him. But you know Him, for he dwells with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you. Yet a little while and the world will no longer see me, but you will see me. Because I live, you also shall live. At that day (meaning the day you‚Äôre born again) you shall know that I am in the Father, and you in me, and I in you. He that has my commandments, and keeps them, is he that loves me. And he that loves me shall be loved of my father, and I will love him, and manifest myself to him.‚Äù</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>There are a lot of big promises in that small passage. He specifically says that he will MANIFEST Himself to you. I have had many Christian friends from the past. None of them as far as I know have ever mentioned a Jesus that was living with them personally. None of them mentioned a Holy Spirit that dwelled within their own physical bodies. Perhaps they didn‚Äôt understand what the verse meant. I don‚Äôt know. Or perhaps they assumed the manifestation of God was not one to be experienced, but was one to be taken by faith. I‚Äôm not sure exactly where the division among church goers is, but this is a serious passage that is misunderstood. For if it was properly understood, than most ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù would realize they may not in fact be Christians. I‚Äôm not trying to be condemning here, though I do realize that‚Äôs probably what it may end up sounding like. I‚Äôm just trying to explain the deception in the Church and how there are many false teachings around the world regarding Christianity.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Anyways, on with the story. I figured if I could somehow be ‚Äúborn again,‚Äù then Jesus would manifest Himself to me. And that‚Äôs what I ‚Äútried‚Äù to do. Be born again. (Though I didn‚Äôt quite know how to. I mind as well have been trying to fly after drinking a can of Red Bull.) All I knew was that Jesus told us to repent of our sins, and He would give us the Holy Spirit as a witness, teacher, and comforter. I was going to do my part, repent. And Jesus would have to do His, which was manifest Himself to me. Simple. So I planned out the day I was going to finally put my faith in Christ and be born again.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The day was a Sunday. I was hoping that Jesus was going to fly down from the clouds to accept me or I was never going to believe in anything ever again. I was at home, on my knees, and I began to speak what I was told I was supposed to say. You know that standard sinner‚Äôs prayer that everyone says when they get saved? Yeah I said that, thinking that Jesus would magically accept me once I confessed my sins and asked for forgiveness. I said it with an open and honest heart. I thought I meant every word, I was on my knees for God‚Äôs sake. And guess what? Nothing. Nothing happened. Here I was on my knees, asking Jesus to take me as I was, and He didn‚Äôt show up. The heck is wrong with this guy? I guess that as a seventeen year old I had some pretty big expectations asking the God of the universe to reveal Himself to me. But I wasn‚Äôt about to believe and follow Him if He wasn‚Äôt real. I had made up my mind that I would not blindly believe in some God who thought He could ask people to have faith in Him when He never even showed Himself to us anywhere.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Such amazing love to die on the cross for my sins but can‚Äôt even reveal Himself to me. When I was on my knees too? And I‚Äôve never gotten on my knees for any God before. This was so pointless, asking a God for help when He didn‚Äôt even exist. Or so I thought. There‚Äôs still more to the story. But at that point I felt so foolish. How gullible to think that a man who lived 2000 years ago preaching that He was God Himself was actually telling the truth. He must have just been a crazy madman who was obsessed with Himself. No wonder why they crucified Him. It didn‚Äôt matter now anyways; He was dead. Just like everyone else He had died and never rose again. That point in my life was when I was more broken than I have ever been. My only hope, a man that lived 2000 years ago, was now gone. That was my last, brilliant idea. So what was next?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Well, there was once again no point to life, no meaning, and no hope, so I guess next was another wave of depression, worse than the previous one. And man that sucked. If only I took a selfie of myself at that time for a keepsake. My thinking was so muddled up I wasn‚Äôt sure which way was right and which way was left. I knew the Gospel. I repented. Jesus never showed up though. I remember reading this one line from a website that said, ‚ÄúOnce you know who Jesus is, you can begin to ask who you are in Him.‚Äù Didn‚Äôt I know Him though? I mean I knew a lot about Him. I knew His teachings, His miracles, and His personality. Maybe I didn‚Äôt quite know Him. I guess to truly know someone you would have to at least meet them first, right?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Well the next few days after I ‚Äútried‚Äù to be born again were pretty sucky to say the least. Didn‚Äôt do much but go to school and come back home and sit around doing nothing; should have tried watching some Netflix, the next best thing after hope. A few days after I had given up on this idea that Jesus was real, I remember going back onto Google just for the heck of it. And I came to a website that was titled, The Seven Words of Jesus on the Cross. And so I read them. But this time when I was reading the words of Jesus on the cross I understood what it really meant. I didn‚Äôt just understand the Gospel logically. I mean I basically had it memorized. I‚Äôm a sinner and Jesus died for my sins, what‚Äôs so hard to understand? But as I was reading the words Jesus said to those who crucified Him, my eyes were opened to the true meaning of the Gospel. Something inside of me just clicked when I read those words.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>‚ÄúFather, forgive them. For they know not what they do.‚Äù I finally understood. Jesus wasn‚Äôt just my hope for a life after death. He Himself was hope. He was hope in its truest form. A God, who had come down from His throne to forgive His own creation for abandoning His ways, a creation that had recklessly departed from a world He had originally intended for love and turned it into a world of their own. We took the world He gave us and replaced it with what we liked better. A world replaced with our own jealousy, anger, pride, greed, and lust. Tell me of something He has given us that we have not at some point ruined. He gave us life; we gave Him rebellion. He offered us wisdom; we offered Him a deaf ear. It seems the more sacred the gift, the worse we do. He gave us marriage; we gave Him adultery. But no it gets worse. He gave us His Son; we gave Him crucifixion. Perhaps once, maybe just once He will finally decide to give us what we deserve; justice for our wrongs. Perhaps He will say that since we appear to want nothing to do with Him, He will separate Himself from us for good. But no He doesn‚Äôt do that either. He decides to do something much different. He pursues us till the very end. He pursues us till death.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Maybe you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúHey now, wait a minute‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve done some bad things in the past, but I‚Äôm certainly not responsible for that last part. I didn‚Äôt crucify Jesus. It was those Jews who lived 2000 years ago, not me.‚Äù But I think you‚Äôre forgetting that Jesus wasn‚Äôt on the cross because the Jews decided to crucify Him. Jesus had said Himself that no man had the power to make Him lay down His life, but that He willingly chose to lay it down for our sake. He was not crucified by force. He was crucified by His own love. His own love that was so deep for humanity that He would go to any length to bring us back to Him. He was crucified for our sins. He was crucified for my sins. I was not the one who physically drove those nails into His wrists, but I was the very reason it had to be done. For once I saw the crucifixion of Jesus for what it truly was. He was crucified because of my very own sinful nature. From that revelation I was able to see that it was not only done by me, but it was done for me as well.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p> This is what God did for all of us 2000 years ago. He gave us what we didn‚Äôt deserve. He gave us grace. He gave us mercy. He gave us forgiveness. He gave us love. He gave us Himself; His own body was crucified on a cross to symbolize the length He would go to redeem us back to Him. Even if we weren‚Äôt yet ready to accept Him, He still had His arms wide open for the time we would be ready to. I finally understood. And with that came a dreadful understanding of what I had done to such a wonderful God. An understanding of whom I actually was compared to the most High God. A God who was so high and lifted up that the angels circling His throne sang, ‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole Earth is filled with His glory.‚Äù And that is when I finally couldn‚Äôt stand. I wasn‚Äôt on my knees by choice this time. Rather I was there because my sins were too much for me to bear on my own. I was there because I was too weak to stand before such a God as holy as this.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I distinctly remember this moment. It was on a Thursday, the afternoon of February 23rd, 2012. This was when the Holy Spirit convicted me of my sinfulness beyond what I could bear. For once my pride melted away as I saw myself for who I really was, a sinful man in need of redemption. God‚Äôs presence was pressing down on me with such force I was instantly aware of just how real He was. As I was on my knees, I knew without a doubt that He was waiting for what I was about to say. I‚Äôm not sure how to describe Him, but His presence was overwhelming. At first, I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I was shaking. I knew that He loved me. So I said what I knew needed to be said. I told Him I was sorry. Sorry for everything I had ever done to Him. Sorry for the way I had lived my life. Sorry for the people I had hurt. Sorry for all the wrongs that I could never undo or take back. My sins were now personally between me and God. I knew kneeling in His presence that my sins were the very thing that had caused His heart to mourn. And I had committed so many of them. Even the simplest of things I had thought weren‚Äôt that bad like yelling at my younger cousin became a burden I couldn‚Äôt bear in the presence of His holiness. For once I was forced to see my sin the way God saw them, and it was not a pretty sight. It was ugly. It was hopeless. But as soon as I had begun to say how sorry I was, I became aware of more than just His great presence. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>His presence enveloped me in what I can only describe as the warmest and most loving embrace I have ever felt. It swept away all the pain; all the guilt and the inescapable feeling of having fallen so short of His standards. It wasn‚Äôt just some type of mental emotion in my head. His presence was literally there physically. The only way I can think of describing it is like when you‚Äôre coming inside a warm house from a cold winter day and the warmth just sinks into you; except this feeling of immense love and warmth wasn‚Äôt from an outside source interacting with my body, but was bursting forth from some deep part within me. This was the love of a savior ‚Äì redeeming, pure, and selfless. His forgiveness was deeper than knowledge itself. It had no bounds because His love had no place it wouldn‚Äôt go for me. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>That is the meaning of the cross. His grace and love was nothing short of a savior who was willing to give up His own life for all of us. Not just to give us an eternal life, but to give us a life with eternal worth. The meaning of the cross is so much more than just salvation. He did it to cleanse us; so that in the glory of His presence we would no longer have to feel ashamed, but that we could stand faultless before His throne. He Himself decided He would restore the intimacy He originally designed for us to have with Him, and He chose to do it through the cross. He vulnerably displayed on the cross the depth of how much He wants a relationship with you. It‚Äôs amazing, but it‚Äôs also weird. We aren‚Äôt used to a love as strong as this; as open, vulnerable, and sacrificial. But it‚Äôs true.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>This is when I was born again. I know it, and nothing anyone can say will ever cause me to doubt that Jesus exists. I knew from the moment His overwhelming love swept through me that He had completely forgiven me on that day. I could not even begin to describe the joy and peace that came upon me. I remember just walking into the living room and just thanking Jesus over and over. I couldn‚Äôt stop. It was as if this huge, invisible weight I hadn‚Äôt even noticed I‚Äôd been carrying my whole life had just been lifted off my shoulders. I was free. I was cleansed. I had been made new.</p>

    <p>I distinctly remember that I didn‚Äôt have the slightest hint of anxiety or fear that day. There was not a shade of disappointment or sadness. It was all just gone, swept away. There was no room for it when I was so filled with the Holy Spirit. It was this crazy sort of peace that I had never before experienced. I remember that I had a BAA basketball game (yeah we all know those can get pretty serious‚Ä¶not really) to go to and I didn‚Äôt even care what happened to be honest. I mean I did play hard, I actually stuffed a kid like half a foot taller than me, (I still remember because the audience was in shock when they saw a me somehow jump high enough to stuff this taller white guy) but the game was so small in comparison to what God had done for me that day. Usually I would get really disappointed and angry when we lost (though I would never show it on my face) but that day I didn‚Äôt even care when my team lost. I wanted to win, but none of the negative emotions I usually had impacted me. I just decided to play harder next time.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>At home I noticed more and more changes. I know now that it was all the result of the Holy Spirit, and that He was making me a new creation, but at the time I was surprised by how easy it was to just remain at peace. I remember when my mom made food for dinner I would always complain. (My God, was I a complainer when it came to eating food at home‚Ä¶) I was always like, ‚ÄúWhat there‚Äôs no chicken?! We have to eat this same food again?! Not rice again!!!‚Äù (We really do eat too much rice.) And I would say all this other random stuff a good mom cooking for her family shouldn‚Äôt have to take from her pesky son. But this time I didn‚Äôt say a thing. I didn‚Äôt even have to try and force myself to not feel tired of eating rice. I was just thankful that she had made dinner for me.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>And so after I ate dinner I went to take a shower. And even though I was sweating from the basketball game, I was like what the heck am I doing this for? I‚Äôm already clean. I say that part jokingly but also seriously because that was how deep God‚Äôs forgiveness ran inside of me. I felt like the holiest man on the planet.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>So afterwards, I headed over to my brother‚Äôs room where the Xbox was. This part requires a little bit of explaining. My cousins and I had formed this sort of tradition where we would play Xbox every day together, right at 9pm sharp. I wanted to explain that part because that day I wasn‚Äôt going to play Xbox because I was bored, which was why I usually played it. I was going to play it because it was sort of like an obligation I had to my cousins. Didn‚Äôt want to let the fellas down, they needed a good Halo partner. (In Halo 3 I was at lvl 43 in lone wolves, so I was pretty boss at it‚Ä¶ just ignore that if you don‚Äôt know that means.) So anyways, I turned on my Xbox and went to sign in to my account. When it connected to the internet a large screen showed up and said that my membership had expired and I no longer had a gold account. (Gold was the version of Xbox live that you paid for that let you play online with other people.) Here is the cool thing though. This membership that expired was one I had paid fifty dollars for. It was a pre-paid one year membership for Xbox live meaning that it could only end on one day of the year. I had played Xbox the night before with my cousins (February 22nd, 2012), so the membership had just so happened to end the day that I was born again‚Ä¶ I guess Jesus was hitting two birds with one stone. No membership. There goes that second addiction of mine, video games.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I still think about that sometimes. That is pretty crazy. I know there‚Äôs probably someone out there saying it was just a coincidence, but you got to admit. That‚Äôs pretty cool. There‚Äôs three hundred sixty five days in a year. That leaves us with 1/365 = 0.0027397. Pretty slim odds if you ask me. But again, I don‚Äôt expect anyone to consider this as proof of God just because the membership ended. That‚Äôs completely ridiculous. But what I do want to say is that God will show you many things when you personally follow Him. It may range from physical signs like something similar to the one above; it could be a physical healing, or something spiritual like a manifestation of the Holy Spirit. You do not have to take other‚Äôs word for it that God exists. You can see for yourself. Just try not to let pride or a desire to sin get in the way of searching for God like I did.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>So I didn‚Äôt end up playing Xbox that day. I don‚Äôt really remember what I did but I still remember the amazing experience God gave me at the end of that day. I was getting ready for bed. I had brushed my teeth and everything, and after getting a drink of water I had finally made it to my bed and was ready to get some rest. I had just lay down and pulled the bed covers over me when I felt this huge wave of God‚Äôs presence come bursting into the room out of nowhere. It actually happened so quickly and His presence was so overwhelming that I wasn‚Äôt sure what was going on. I guess to truly describe it; I had a slight millisecond of being utterly surprised and actually slightly fearful at what I was experiencing because I didn‚Äôt know what was going to happen. It felt as if my room was about to collapse on me or something. And then without a moment of hesitation, God‚Äôs presence swept over me, but this time stronger than anything I had experienced that day. It was a peace that is truly indescribable. Not even worthy of being compared to where I talked about there being no anxiety or fear. This was a kind of peace that overloaded my entire system. I couldn‚Äôt talk. I couldn‚Äôt even think. I am convinced that had it not been for me lying in my bed when this happened, say I had been standing up, I would fallen down flat to the ground for sure.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>All I could do was just lay there and enjoy the peace that God gave me. I knew in that moment that He was extremely pleased with what I had done that day. Even though it was as simple and clear cut as confessing Him as savior, I had made a commitment that day to follow Him, and He had made a commitment to never leave me or forsake me. This peace lasted perhaps 7-10 seconds or so, but it didn‚Äôt just abruptly end. Instead, I was kind of whisked away into a deep sleep. I distinctly remember that as He gave me that amazing peace, my vision got darker and darker, kind of like a movie fade out. I just fell asleep in a matter of a few seconds from His presence. I remember that night that I didn‚Äôt have any dreams at all. I just remember waking up the next day energized and feeling like I was on top of the world. It was the best night of sleep I had ever gotten.</p>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>And that is the end of my testimony of Christ regarding the first day I met Him. Wow that took forever, but to do Him justice I can‚Äôt just sum Him up in a few sentences. Though I think perhaps I may have gone a little overboard. I have many other things I could share that God has shown me as I continue to walk with Him, but I don‚Äôt want to talk about that right now. I think I‚Äôve talked enough about myself already (though I only do this because I can only be a witness to the things I have experienced, not things others have). But this website isn‚Äôt supposed to be about me, it‚Äôs supposed to be about Jesus. I am writing this current page about two and a half years after I met Him. I can truly say that He keeps His promises. If you decide to follow Him, He will not forsake you. He will never leave you. I still feel His presence just as clearly as I did that day two and a half years ago. What I wonder most is not if you believe my story, it is if you want to find God for yourself. He rejects no one. The cross is ample evidence of that.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>But many will reject Him. They will reject Him for the simple fact that they do not want Him to be Lord of their lives. People like driving their own cars. We don‚Äôt like letting someone else drive our own car for us, especially when we got a pimped out car like a Lamborghini or something. We want to go to the places we want to go, not be led onto a road that may lead us away from our wants, desires, and goals. The irony of it is that we are all searching for something to fulfill that deep part of us, but we all seem to begin our search in the most empty of places. Sometimes the only time we truly decide to give it all up to God is when things get hopeless. When we finally see that what we thought to be driving wasn‚Äôt actually a Lambo, but a crappy, old Ford pick-up. But in that revelation we discover our folly in never letting Him lead us in the first place.</p>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>This is Jesus, the One who created the mountains, the rainforests, the oceans, and the stars. Not to mention the lion, the mouse, and the fox. And sugar. He made that too. If you think that you can‚Äôt learn anything from this God, then I think you‚Äôre a little crazy and over your head. He is the epitome of love, grace, and forgiveness. If we all decided to learn a little more from Him I think we could fix a lot more of the world‚Äôs problems. But that‚Äôs just my two cents.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>You can lead your own life. It is yours after all. But don‚Äôt forget that there was One who paid a steep price to redeem your life. And He didn‚Äôt do it because He wanted to control you and be Lord over your life. He did it because He loves you and wants what‚Äôs best for you. You were made in His image. You were made for holiness. Many of us have fallen for the lie that the things of God are the least ‚Äúfun.‚Äù We have become a broken society lost in an age of sensuality and selfish pursuits. It is perhaps one of the biggest obstacles that stand in the way of someone coming to know Christ. Will they want to give up their sins in order to follow Christ?  We have all eaten from the tree containing the forbidden fruit, but Jesus is still offering us to come and eat from the tree of life. To taste and see that it is good.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I am aware that there are a large portion of people with a skewed representation of who Jesus really is. There are also many people who think that Christians are just crazy, stupid, and delusional. And in some ways I can‚Äôt really blame them because the image of Christ has been ruined, in part, because of the church. We have misrepresented Christ in so many ways, simply because many Christians have not truly come to know Jesus. We are living in a world where Christians are known as Catholics, Lutherans, Baptists, Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, Mormons . . . what the heck is going on? I thought we were supposed to be one body. You know, the body of Christ, where Jesus is the head? Yet we have all these different beliefs of Jesus each with their own different twists. And on top of this, we have other Christians proclaiming absurdities such as the Earth being only around 6000 years old, sending any rational thinker out the door and further away from Christ. Do not allow your perception of who Jesus is become defined by the way Christians act. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense to do this. We are sinners and hypocrites just like everyone else, and we don‚Äôt always have all the answers. (Sometimes we aren‚Äôt even asking the right questions.) But instead, I urge you to look at the person of Jesus and see if you can find any fault in Him.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The one who loses if you choose to not have a relationship with Him is ultimately you. It is your choice to make. Aren‚Äôt we all thirsty? Yet we drink from forbidden waters that we think will taste sweeter instead of drinking from the One who said He Himself was the fountain of life. The One who said if you would drink from the water He gave to you, you would never thirst but would inherit a spring of water that would burst forth into everlasting life.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I know life is busy ‚Äì school, work, family, friends, parties, football, facebook, twitter. And don‚Äôt forget Netflix. But to never get to know Christ, the One by whom all things are being made new, would be in my opinion, one of the worst mistakes one could make. You were made for Him.  There are many out there who don‚Äôt realize that they were meant for a one-on-one relationship with the God of the universe. I guess some people like to call this the ‚ÄúGod vacuum,‚Äù a space that only God can fill. You can settle for the lesser things in life to fill this if you like ‚Äì money, sex, fame, success . . . Netflix :) But it cannot come close to an intimate relationship with Jesus. And that may be weird and hard to understand because if you don‚Äôt know Jesus then you probably don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs so great about Him. But get to know Him. He won‚Äôt disappoint you.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong now. I‚Äôm not asking you to go running to the door every time you hear another Jehovah‚Äôs Witness ringing your doorbell. I just hope that your life hasn‚Äôt become so busy, or your mind hasn‚Äôt turned so numb that you can no longer hear the knocking of the Holy Spirit at the door to your heart. He doesn‚Äôt even care if your doorbell is working or not, He ain‚Äôt gonna stop knocking because He wants to come in. Your heart is locked on the inside not on the outside. Only those you have ever allowed in have a place there. If you so choose to let Him in, I can guarantee this ‚Äì you will not regret it!</p>
